# trans-game
In-progress game development for better education of the trans experience.

## What is this?
This is a fun project started by [Noah Berlove](https://github.com/switch86) in an attempt to create a Role Playing Game
that educates about the trans experience in a fresh and humourous way, while still capturing the authentic struggles we face.
This repository (forked from the original) already contains a Minimum Viable Project in the `RPG` directory written with `node.js`,
which is a functional proof-of-concept.

## Development Plan
Our plan is to develop this concept and game further, while leveraging the gaming medium as a unique tool for education that
embraces the depth of wisdom that can come from really experiencing "walking in another person's shoes".  We also want to provide
an experience that enables others (who may not be trans) to enjoy the delight that acceptance and inclusivity can bring, without
shying away from both the difficulties and the humor involved in real life gender non-conformity.

We aim to include accurrate statistics from reputable sources in medicine, psychology, and other disciplines not only as a functional
part of the dialogue of the game, but integrated within the design of the game itself to produce realistic life situations based on
probabalistic engines.  Stories and scenarios in the game will be gathered from or based on authentic stories of trans people, and the
story and software development will be entirely done by trans folks.

### Goal
The major goal is to both capture real trans experiences as a playable game, and produce a rich educational experience that is
understandable, humorous, and relatable.

## Introduction to the Game
> "Welcome to the trans experience!
>
> Imagine yourself existing in the world as a trans person. Life isn't easy, but there are good things too. You'll encounter all kinds of transphobic microaggressions and friends/community members in this world and will have to decide how to interact with them. This game is meant to be fun an educational while showing the kinds of microaggressions that embolden and enable the more insidious violence. The reality in the world is far more brutal, especially for trans women and even more so for trans women of color.

> You can think of your Resistance Quotient (RQ) as your overall health - if you run all the way out the game is over. If you win ten awards by overcoming transphobes, you'll be declared pro trans. Try again and again to see how high you can score!
